# Examplar
Examplar is a platform that allow students to work on solutions for past exam papers collaboratively.

## How it works
Search your course, either by name or by course code, and filter the results by entering your university. Each course page contains a list of exam solutions. You are only permitted to view solutions as a guest. Once you've made an account you are able to post, upvote, or downvote exam solutions.
